## Hello there   

My name is Daniel, I am 18 years old. I am a beginner in web development.
I was confused about which career to pursue, and as soon as I saw videos about programming and web development, the way the developers talked and helped each other and demonstrated how much they liked what they did, I was delighted.

Since then I study self-taught web development in search of becoming a developer as well. I never really thought about technology, how exciting and fun it is. Was it love at first sight, kind of clich√©? Yes haha, but it is a fact
