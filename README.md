## Hello there   

My name is Daniel and I recently turned 18.
I was confused about what career to pursue, and after watching some videos on programming and web development,
the way that the developers spoke and demonstrated how much they liked what they did, I was delighted.

Since then I study web development and English every day in a self-taught way in search of becoming a developer too.
I never really thought about technology, how exciting and fun it is. It was love at first sight haha
